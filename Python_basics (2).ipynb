        ". Python is a Programming language that is easy to understand and write, making it a popular choice among developers and programmers.\n",
        ". It is Compatible with various programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        ". Python has a large and active community of developers, an extensive standard library, and third-party packages for various domains.\n",

        "\n",
        "Predefined keywords\n",
        "\n",
        "Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of keywords include if, else, while, for, def, class, import, try, except, return. True, False, None, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keywords are case-sensitive and cannot be redefined or overridden within a Python program.\n",

        "In Python, objects can be either changeable (modifiable) or unchangeable (unchangeable).\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable objects, such as lists and dictionaries, can be modified after creation, while immutable objects, such as tuples and strings, cannot.\n",

        "Operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to carry out specific actions on numbers or variables in Python expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python supports various types of operators, including arithmetic operators (...), comparison operators (=, =, <, >), logical operators (and, or, not), assignment operators (, +,-,*,/), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operators have precedence and associativity rules that determine the order of evaluation in expressions.\n",

        "Example-\n",
        "\n",
        "In mathematics and computer programming, an operator is a character that represents a specific mathematical or logical action or process. For instance, \"x\" is an arithmetic operator that indicates multiplication, while \"&&\" is a logical operator representing the logical AND function in programming.\n",

        "\n",
        "Type Casting\n",
        "\n",
        "Type casting, also referred to as type conversion, is the process of changing one data type to another in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Type casting is often necessary for performing arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and input/output operations in Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example-\n",
        "you want to change the data type of a variable from an integer ( 2 ) to a float ( 2.0 ). This is a case where you'd use type casting.\n",

        "\n",
